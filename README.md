### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my profile, my name is Allan Torres and I stand out in the following technologies:

Javascript | HTML | CSS | React | Redux | Node JS | Express | SQL | PostgreSQL | Sequelize | GIT | Agile SCRUM work methodologies

I have been passionate about IT development, it is a world full of challenges that makes me a proactive person, adaptable to constant changes. I have also been a musician throughout my life which has led me to be in a permanent creative process, this makes me feel a lot of empathy for my work as a software developer, at present I am a fullstack developer and a university technician in computer science full of enthusiasm to take on great challenges.

I really enjoy working as a team, seeking excellence and working so that common goals are met.

I stand out for my great capacity for adaptation and problem solving.

ðŸš€ Some of my main projects:

- Academic Project - Full Stack Development Henry Videogames
"Video Games App" Oct-Dec, 2021. Development of an application
using React and Redux as state management. All the
components were developed with CSS without the use of libraries
external. The application consumes data from the API
https://api.rawg.io/api/ through a backend developed in
Node.JS using Express, adding new functionalities to the
Original API. Some features of the project: Search cache,
sorts and filters, controlled form for the creation of
new games.
