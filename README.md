### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my profile, my name is Allan Torres and I stand out in the following technologies:

Javascript | HTML | CSS | React | Redux | Node JS | Express | SQL | PostgreSQL | Sequelize | GIT | Agile SCRUM work methodologies

I have been passionate about IT development, it is a world full of challenges that makes me a proactive person, adaptable to constant changes. I have also been a musician throughout my life which has led me to be in a permanent creative process, this makes me feel a lot of empathy for my work as a software developer, at present I am a fullstack developer and a university technician in computer science full of enthusiasm to take on great challenges.

I really enjoy working as a team, seeking excellence and working so that common goals are met.

I stand out for my great capacity for adaptation and problem solving.
